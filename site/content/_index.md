  content:
    production: >-
      Night Drive was filmed over three days in a duvetyne covered garage using
      rear projection and poor manâ€™s process to create the driving effect. The
      original story was written three years ago as a reflection on personal
      experiences and as the initial step in the pursuit of a career in film
      production.
    statement: >-
      This film is about dealing with the grief one experiences after having
      lost someone. I want to connect with the audience on a visceral level in
      ways in which words alone cannot accomplish.
    synopsis: >-
      Otto reluctantly crawls into a '79 Firebird alongside his old friend
      Perso. Through the suburbs, city, and desert, Perso prods and goads Otto
      forward along the drive slowly revealing the underlying truths of their
      relationship and the dark purpose of their journey.
