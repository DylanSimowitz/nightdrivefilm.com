blurb:
  heading: Why Kaldi?
  text: >-
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone.

    synopsis: >-
      Otto reluctantly crawls into a '79 Firebird alongside his old friend
      Perso. Through the suburbs, city, and desert, Perso prods and goads Otto
      forward along the drive slowly revealing the underlying truths of their
      relationship and the dark purpose of their journey.
    production: >-
      Night Drive was filmed over three days in a duvetyne covered garage using rear
      projection and poor man’s process to create the driving effect. The original
      story was written three years ago as a reflection on personal experiences and
      as the initial step in the pursuit of a career in film production.
    statement: >-
      This film is about dealing with the grief one experiences after having lost someone.
      I want to connect with the audience on a visceral level in ways in which words alone
      cannot accomplish.
